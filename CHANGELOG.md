# MCP Server Plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-03-18 — Feature: Remote Component References via MCP

**Problem:** The MCP tool `set_component_property` did not support assigning `Component` or `GameObject` references. The underlying JSON value parser failed with an `Invalid cast` exception when given a generic GUID string.

**Solution:** Added explicit support in `ConvertJsonValue` to check for `targetType` assignability to `Component` and `GameObject`. If the incoming value is a GUID string or an object with an `id`/`Id` field, the MCP server now traverses the scene and resolves the reference dynamically. This allows tools to natively establish component linkages like `BoneMergeTarget` dynamically via MCP.

**Files Changed:**
- `Editor/OzmiumWriteHandlers.cs` — Enhanced `ConvertJsonValue()` to resolve references via `OzmiumSceneHelpers.WalkAll()` and updated `SchemaSetComponentProperty`.

### 2026-03-18 — Fix: Scene Resolution Priority

**Problem:** All scene query tools (`get_scene_summary`, `find_game_objects`, `get_scene_hierarchy`, etc.) returned a minimal 4-object runtime scene instead of the actual editor scene. This made all scene inspection and manipulation tools non-functional when the game wasn't playing.

**Root Cause:** `ResolveScene()` in both `OzmiumSceneHelpers.cs` and `SceneToolHandlers.cs` checked `Game.ActiveScene` first. Since `Game.ActiveScene` is always non-null (returns a minimal runtime "Scene"), the `SceneEditorSession` fallback was never reached.

**Fix:** Reordered `ResolveScene()` to prioritize `SceneEditorSession.Active` (the editor scene the user is working with) and only fall back to `Game.ActiveScene` as a last resort.

**Files Changed:**
- `Editor/OzmiumSceneHelpers.cs` — `ResolveScene()`
- `Editor/SceneToolHandlers.cs` — `ResolveScene()`

### 2026-03-18 — Feature: `(MCP IGNORE)` Name Marker

**Problem:** Large map objects (e.g. Aerowalk with 900+ child objects) cause MCP scene queries to time out because they walk every object in the scene.

**Solution:** Two approaches to mark objects as ignored by MCP:
1. **Name marker**: Add `(MCP IGNORE)` anywhere in the GameObject's name (e.g. "Aerowalk (MCP IGNORE)")
2. **Tag**: Add the `mcp_ignore` tag to the GameObject

Both approaches skip the object and its entire subtree during all MCP scene traversals.

Also fixed `get_editor_context` which was calling `WalkAll().Count()` to count objects per session — replaced with `scene.Children.Count` to avoid walking the entire tree.

**Files Changed:**
- `Editor/AssetToolHandlers.cs` — replaced `WalkAll().Count()` with `Children.Count` in `get_editor_context`
- `Editor/OzmiumSceneHelpers.cs` — `IgnoreMarker` + `IgnoreTag` constants, `WalkSubtree()` filter
- `Editor/SceneQueryHelpers.cs` — `IgnoreMarker` + `IgnoreTag` constants, `WalkSubtree()` filter
- `Editor/SceneToolHandlers.cs` — inline hierarchy walk functions
- `Editor/OzmiumReadHandlers.cs` — `Walk()` method and rootOnly loop

### 2026-03-18 — Feature: Auto-Skip Large Subtrees

**Problem:** Even without manual tagging, large map objects (e.g. Aerowalk with 900+ children) cause MCP queries to hang.

**Solution:** Objects with more than 25 direct children are automatically treated as "too large to walk." The parent object is still returned in results (so users know it exists with its `childCount`), but its children are not recursively walked. Users can still explicitly query a specific object by ID/name to get its full details.

**Files Changed:**
- `Editor/OzmiumSceneHelpers.cs` — `MaxAutoWalkChildren` constant + check in `WalkSubtree()`
- `Editor/SceneQueryHelpers.cs` — `MaxAutoWalkChildren` constant + check in `WalkSubtree()`

### 2026-03-18 — Fix: GameTask.MainThread Deadlocks

**Problem:** All MCP tools abruptly began hanging indefinitely. The MCP connection would stay open but never return a result because the `.NET` background thread pool was silently dropping the engine's main thread continuation. S&box automatically deleted duplicate/conflicting `mcpserver.dll` plugins during cleanup, exposing the underlying threading issue.

**Root Cause:** Incoming JSON-RPC requests were being dispatched via a raw `.NET` `Task.Run()`, which lacks S&box's internal task scheduling context. Calling `await GameTask.MainThread()` from this detached context caused the game engine to lose track of the continuation, permanently hanging the tool executing.

**Fix:** Replaced the raw `Task.Run()` call with S&box's native `GameTask.RunInThreadAsync()`. This ensures the engine tracks the task context, allowing safe dispatching back to the main thread for editor/scene manipulation.

**Files Changed:**
- `Editor/SboxMcpServer.cs` — Swapped `Task.Run()` -> `GameTask.RunInThreadAsync()` inside `HandleMessage()`
- `sbox_mcp.sbproj` — Erased `CsProjName` override to halt generation of duplicate `.csproj` clones.
